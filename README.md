# Dotfiles

This is going to be a constant work in progress while I get everything set up. Heavily ~~copied~~ _influenced_ by [Ted's custom vim config](https://github.com/tedkulp/vim-config).

## Setup

1. `git clone git://github.com/squarefrog/dotfiles.git`
2. `cd dotfiles`
3. `sh setup.sh`

---

## Required packages

First, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), then the required brews:

    brew install macvim
    brew install tmux
    brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
